            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm Daniel Bacaicoa. I'm currently immersed in my Ph.D. adventure, specializing in Signal Processing and Communication Engineering at UC3M. But I promise, it's way more exciting than it sounds!</p>
            <p>My journey into the world of numbers began with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics. Intrigued by the practical application of stochastic processes, I embarked on a journey to earn a Master's degree in Quantitative Finance. After that, I pursued a Master's in Applied Statistics to add a touch of formality to my knowledge gained from the Quantitative Finance program. Also, I've got a strong passion for teaching, so I also pursued a Master's in Secondary Education. I just can't resist sharing what I know with others. I'm a believer that learning should never stop, and these degrees are my way of proving it.</p>
            <p>When I'm not digging into mathematics, I'm out there on the court trying my hand at tennis and padel. No, I'm not exactly the next Federer (my backhand is also one-handed), but I'm having a blast and giving it my all. I also love swimming, and lately, I've embraced the world of running.</p>
            <p>But I'm not just a math and sports enthusiast. I love being outdoors, exploring nature, or simply enjoying quality time with my wonderful family and friends.</p>
            <p>You can find me on my social media profiles:</p>
